# SCT_CS_2
Developed a Python GUI tool to securely encrypt and decrypt images using pixel-level manipulation. Users can browse images externally, choose Encrypt/Decrypt, select a method (xor, add, swap), and enter a key. The tool automatically saves the results, making image security easy and interactive.
